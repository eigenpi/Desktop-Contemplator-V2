# Desktop Contemplator V2.0

## Description

This is an Arduino project using an Arduino Mega board to show on a
TFT display several different visual effects. You can select via 
three TFT buttons one of three different types of patterns to 
render for your enjoyment: 1) fractals, 2) plasmas, or 3) cool geometry.
